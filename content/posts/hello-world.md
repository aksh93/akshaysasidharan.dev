I've been wanting to blog for quite sometime now.
What held me back from doing it was mainly the thought of having redundant content.
The perks of starting to program professionally within the Rails community is that most of the challenging things that you'd normally come across would have well explained solutions present - be it blog posts, video tutorials, stack overflow answers etc.
This is of course very fortunate for budding programmers, as one just needs to master the art of *Google fu*.


But I'm now realising that this line of thought is actually incorrect. Redundancy here also gives out different perspectives.
And it might be your perspective that would actually resonate and provide better understanding to a particular individual.
This notion beautifully put out on a [keynote](https://youtu.be/X25xOhntr6s?t=2785) by Jesicca Kerr at ElixirConf 2015. If you are to imagine a flight of stairs as a path to technical nirvana. The person uptop might be the expert but he/she wouldn't be able to guide you as good as the person just one step above you.

In my hustle to climb up the stairs to technical nirvana, planning to be motivated and create out content for folks who'd follow.

And by programmer tradition - this snippet goes without saying for this post:

```ruby
puts 'Hello world!'
```
